# Week 1 - Introduction to Java
## Introduction covered:
- Installing Java `brew cask install java`
- Basic terminal commands
- Git commands `brew install git`
- Coding right away in Java

## Java Key Concepts:
- Everything is a **class**
- Functions are called **methods** and are called inside *main*
- `{ }` are used to *start* and *end* code
- All statements must end in **;** 
- All variables must be declared types 
- Meaning **Java** = **static**(ly) typed language
- Functions must have a return type
- If not returning anything use `void`
- You need to **compile first** `javac fileName.java` before runnning your program `java fileName`
- **Type errors** are found during *compiling* instead of a runtime

## Static typing benefits: 
- Types checked **before** program *even runs*
- Compiled files can be distributed knowing there's *no type errors*
- Since *everything has a type* the programmer can easily understand and reason through the code

## Comments about commenting:
- **Comments** are *highly recommended* for markup, readability and other purposes
- Since code can get pretty large quickly it helps to comment often
> You can comment using `//` or `/* */` or `/** */`
